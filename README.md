# Hello UwU

My name is Gabriel G. de Brito.

I'm a Computer Science student at [computing department of the Federal
University of Paran√°](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/dinf/).

I make cool stuff at the [HiPES Research Group](https://github.com/hipes-ufpr).

I'm interested in computer architecture and chip design, parallel and high
efficient programming, compilers, hardware and hardware acceleration.
