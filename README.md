# Hello UwU

My name is Gabriel G. de Brito.

I'm a Computer Science student at [computing department of the Federal
University of Paran√°](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/dinf/). I'm interested
in computer architecture and chip design, parallel and high efficient
programming, compilers, hardware and hardware acceleration.
